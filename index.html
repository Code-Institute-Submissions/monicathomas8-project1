                <h2>What is Meditation</h2>
                <p>
                    Meditation is a practice of being still in body and mind with awareness of one self.  
                    Meditation has been around for years, the 5th Century B.C in fact! It plays a vital part in many cultures around the world. There are many types of meditation to practice and ponder over, each method is unique and carries many different elements.
                    The one thing they all have in common is that they all focus on connecting the body and mind together. One of the most common types is Mindfulness Meditation, which was created by Siddhartha Gautama AKA Budda!
                    Meditation can easily be incorporated into any lifestyle, everyone and anyone can do it.
