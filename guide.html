                    <ol>
                        <li>Find a quite placed where you will not be disturbed.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure your phone is away and you do not need to be on call for anything important.</li>
                            <li>You can follow this practice for as long as you want or you can set a timer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Sit on a cushion or comfortable chair (I like to sit on a cushion with my legs crossed).</li>
                        <li>Rest your hands on your lap using your knees, or thighs. Make sure your arms and legs are relaxed and your back is supported.</li>
                        <li>With your back straight, take a deep slow breath in and gently close your eyes.</li>
                        <li>As you breath in, try not to think it and make sure your breathing is comfortable for you.</li>
                        <li>As you exhale, try to let all your thoughts in your mind exhale with your breath.</li>
                        <li>Breathe in again following this pattern, start to count your breaths as you do and keep this your only focus.</li>
                        <li>When thoughts creep into your mind (trust me, they will), tell yourself to <strong>relax</strong> and get ready to focus on your breathing again.</li>
                        <li>Simply start your breath counting from 1 again and keep going.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Congratulations, you have just completed a simple meditation!
