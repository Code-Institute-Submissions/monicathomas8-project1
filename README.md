<h1>Monica's Meditation Corner</h1>
<h2>Project 1</h2>

The website is designed for people who are new to meditation and would like to know more and how to get started. It has 3 pages consists of an example guide for users to follow,  and has a breathing technique with step-by-step instructions. It touches a little on the history of meditation and lists several benefits from regular practice. It also shows how someone can fit meditation into a part of their day. 

The site is targeted towards people who are new to meditation and have an interest in learning more.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Header, Navigation and Footer</h3>
The Header shows the name of the website and the name shows it has been created by a single person and not a company.
The Navigation bar is featured on top of each page in the header. It has links to each page and the home page. The links are: Get in touch, calming breathing technique, guided meditation and the home page. The colors are soft and calming and contrast with the background.  
The Footer is in the same colors and has copyright information and links to Facebook and Instagram.

<h3>Home Page</h3> 
The home page consists of units of information on meditation. It covers what meditation is. A little of the history of meditation and where it comes from. How to fit meditation into your day. The benefits of regular practice. What issues people have said can help to ease. 
The colors are consistent with the header and navigation bar and the background image is a calming image of trees. It gives the whole page a soft feel.

<h3>Easy Meditation for Beginners</h3>
<h4>page 2</h4>
This is a guided, step-by-step practice of meditation. It focuses on mindfulness and is easy for people new to meditation to follow along. The colors are consistent with the header and navigation bar and the background image is of a woman demonstrating how to sit in a chair and meditate. It's a subtle way to have a demonstration without having too much on the page.

#Testing
I have tested it on different browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. 
I can confirm the project is responsive and functions on different screen sizes. 
The form works and requires entries in each input field.

#Bugs
##Solved Bugs
When I deployed to Github. I discovered that my CSS code was causing issues and making the main content overlap with the header and footer. I had to correct the CSS code mainly Flexbox to make sure it was user-friendly. 

##Unsolved Bugs
The video size is smaller than I would like it to be. With other code, it would sit on top of the page and not in its desired place. For this reason, I had to make it smaller than I would have liked to fit. My workaround is you can click to enlarge the video.

#Validator Testing
HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. 
CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator.

<h1>Summary</h1>
I designed this site starting from a desktop view. If I had more time I would have started from a mobile view and made it more adaptive. I would like to add a quiz for users to find out their meditation style and make it more interactive for the user. 
Thank you for viewing my first project.
