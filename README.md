##Features

####Header, Navigation and Footer
The Header shows the name of the website and the name shows it has been created by a single person and not a company.
The Navigation bar is featured on top of each page in the header. It has links to each page and the home page. The links are: Get in touch, calming breathing technique, guided meditation and the home page. The colors are soft and calming and contrast with the background.  
The Footer is in the same colors and has copyright information and links to Facebook and Instagram

###Home page 
The home page consists of units of information on meditation. It covers what meditation is. A little of the history of meditation and where it comes from. How to fit meditation into your day. The benefits of regular practice. What issues people have said can help to ease. 
The colors are consistent with the header and navigation bar and the background image is a calming image of trees. It gives the whole page a soft feel. 

###Easy Meditation for Beginners (page 2)
This is a guided, step-by-step practice of meditation. It focuses on mindfulness and is easy for people new to meditation to follow along. The colors are consistent with the header and navigation bar and the background image is of a woman demonstrating how to sit in a chair and meditate. It's a subtle way to have a demonstration without having too much on the page.

###5 Minute Breathing Technique (page 3)
This is a guided step-by-step breathing technique that can help calm your mind in any situation. The page follows the same design as the others for consistency and has a different background image of soft green trees. It also has a video so users can view how the technique can be performed. 

###Stay In Touch Page (page 4)
This is a signup form for users to stay in touch with the website author. 

#Testing
I have tested it on different browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. 
I can confirm the project is responsive and functions on different screen sizes. 
The form works and requires entries in each input field.

#Bugs
##Solved Bugs
When I deployed to Github. I discovered that my CSS code was causing issues and making the main content overlap with the header and footer. I had to correct the CSS code mainly Flexbox to make sure it was user-friendly. 

##Unsolved Bugs
The video size is smaller than I would like it to be. With other code, it would sit on top of the page and not in its desired place. For this reason, I had to make it smaller than I would have liked to fit. My workaround is you can click to enlarge the video.

#Validator Testing
HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. 
CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator.

#Summary
I designed this site starting from a desktop view. If I had more time I would have started from a mobile view and made it more adaptive. I would like to add a quiz for users to find out their meditation style and make it more interactive for the user.
